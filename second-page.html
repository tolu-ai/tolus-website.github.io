        <h3>Hot Takes on 2023-2024 Celtics Team</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Although trading Marcus Smart for Porzingis and Holiday definitly hurt, it was more than necessary! While scoring points helps during games, its 
                defense that ultimaelty wins games. This is exactly what Holiday is for, along with Derrick White! With the two of them on defense the season became much more easier from my POV.
            </li>
            <li>A lot of the discourse/complaints about Jaylen Brown getting Finals MVP over Tatum was not needed. If you watched a handful of the 
                games during the playoffs or even the regular season, it would be quite clear why he deserved it. He showed up every night much more consistent
                as opposed to Tatum, who like most players had a handful of bad games. </li>
            <li>Porzingis's prefomance during Game 1 of the finals proves that man was not injured thattt long. He was getting injected with compound V.</li>
